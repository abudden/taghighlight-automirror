2.1 Introduction                         *TagHighlight-intro*               {{{2

    This set of scripts is designed to increase the number of highlighting
    groups used by Vim.  This makes it quicker and easier to spot errors in
    your code.  By using ctags and parsing the output, the typedefs, #defines,
    enumerated names etc are all clearly highlighted in different colours.
    
    The idea was based on the comments in |tag-highlight|, but I wanted to
    take it a little further.
    
    This is achieved through a little python script to interact with ctags and
    to parse the result and a small Vim script that makes Vim read the
    resulting files.  Finally, a new command (:UpdateTypesFile) is added (with
    optional !  for recursive operation) to keep the generated files up to
    date.
    
    At present, the highlighter supports the following languages:
    
        * C/C++
        * C#
        * Java
        * Perl
        * PHP
        * Python
        * Ruby (largely untested)
        * VHDL (if your version of ctags supports it)
    
    It should also work correctly with Charles Campbell's rainbow.vim bracket
    highlighter.
    
    The vast majority of the testing has been with C source code, so I'd be
    very interested in any feedback on the use with C++ and the various other
    languages.

    Currently requires exuberant ctags or one of its derivatives.  Exuberant
    ctags is available from:
>
    http://ctags.sourceforge.net
<
    Adding more languages is extremely simple, see
    |TagHighlight-adding|.
    
                                         *TagHighlight-website*

2.2 Commands                             *TagHighlight-commands*            {{{2

    The following commands are provided by this plugin:

	:UpdateTypesFile                 *UpdateTypesFile*

	    This command creates the syntax highlighting file used to show the
	    extra colouring.  It then updates all of the open files
	    automatically.  By default, it only looks for source files in the
	    current directory.  However, see |UpdateTypesFile!| and
	    |TagHL-Recurse|.

	:UpdateTypesFile!                *UpdateTypesFile!*
    
	    This command operates in the same way as |UpdateTypesFile| except
	    that it looks for source files recursively into subdirectories.
	    It automatically excludes directories named either "docs" or
	    "Documentation".  See also |TagHL-Recurse|.

	:UpdateTypesFileOnly             *UpdateTypesFileOnly*

	    This command operates in the same manner as |UpdateTypesFile|, but
	    it uses the current tags file rather than generating a new one
	    (useful if you're generating tags files as part of your build
	    process.

	:ReadTypes			 *ReadTypes*

	    This comment can be used to manually read in any types files to
	    highlight keywords.  Generally not likely to be used as the
	    built-in autocmds should load the types files when a file is
	    loaded or the types files are updated.

2.3 Colouring                            *TagHighlight-colours*             {{{2

    The tag highlighter uses a number of additional highlighting groups to
    differentiate between different types of tag.  These are not supported as
    standard by many colour schemes.  You can either download the "bandit"
    colour scheme from:
>
    http://sites.google.com/site/abudden/contents/Vim-Scripts/bandit-colour-scheme
<
    (screenshots of C source code on the |TagHighlight-website|) or you
    can configure the extra highlighting groups yourself.  The following
    highlight groups should be defined:

	ClassName       : Class
    	DefinedName     : Define
    	Enumerator      : Enumerator
    	Function        : Function or method
    	EnumerationName : Enumeration name
    	Member          : Member (of structure or class)
    	Structure       : Structure Name
    	Type            : Typedef
    	Union           : Union Name
    	GlobalConstant  : Global Constant
    	GlobalVariable  : Global Variable
    	LocalVariable   : Local Variable

    An example of how to highlight one of these would be to include the
    following line in your colour scheme (see |:highlight|):
>
	hi Enumerator guifg="c000c0"
<
    You can, of course, also link the groups to another highlighting group
    using something like:
>
        hi link Type Keyword
<
    However, this probably defies the point of having the tag highlighter in
    the first place!

2.4 Configuration                        *TagHighlight-config*              {{{2

    There are a large number of configuration options that allow customisation
    of the operation of the highlighter.  For simple use, none of these really
    need to be set.  Options can be set globally, per project or per buffer;
    see |TagHighlight-how-options| for more information.

2.4.1 How to Set Options                 *TagHighlight-how-options*         {{{3

    Options can be set globally, per project or per buffer.  Global options
    are overridden by project options, which in turn are overridden by
    buffer-specific options.

	Global Options			 *g:TagHighlightSettings*

	    Global options are set in a global |Dictionary|.  The variable
	    name is |g:TagHighlightSettings|.  The keys in the dictionary are
	    the option names and the values are the option values.  The safest
	    way to set a value in this dictionary is to use something like
	    this:
>
		if ! exists('g:TagHighlightSettings')
		    let g:TagHighlightSettings = {}
		endif
		let g:TagHighlightSettings['Recurse'] = 1
		let g:TagHighlightSettings['CtagsExecutable'] = 'etags.exe'
<
	    If you want to override any existing options (or you want to be
	    lazy...) you can probably also do it this way:
>
		let g:TagHighlightSettings = {'Recurse': 1, 'CtagsExecutable': 'etags.exe'}

2.4.2 Option Summary                     *TagHighlight-option-list*         {{{3

    There are a lot of options for TagHighlight.  They are mentioned in this
    section, grouped by their purpose.  You can find an alphabetical list with
    more details in |TagHighlight-option-details|.  Along side each option
    name is a link, starting with TagHL- and then the option name (to avoid
    namespace clashes with other plugins).  Use CTRL-] on the TagHL- prefixed
    option name to jump to detailed help on it.

3.1 Adding More Languages                *TagHighlight-adding*              {{{2

    1. Run ctags --list-languages and check that the required language is
       present.

    2. Create a new file in plugin/TagHighlight/data/languages/ with a .txt
       extension (the file name can be anything you want).  Set the fileformat
       to be 'unix' for consistency and don't expand tabs in case you need to
       add any multi-line lists:
>
	    set ff=unix noet
<
    3. In that file, add the following fields in Key:Value format (one per
       line):

	    FriendlyName - Whatever you prefer to call the language

	    CTagsName - Whatever ctags refers to the language as

	    PythonExtensionMatcher - A python regular expression that matches
				     the extensions of files that are written
				     in this language.

	    VimExtensionMatcher - The Vim regular expression version of
				  PythonExtensionMatcher.

	    Suffix - Whatever you would like the generated files to be named,
		     e.g. for C code, the suffix is c and the generated files
		     are by default called types_c.taghl

    4. Optionally, add other fields as required:

	    SkipList - Any specific ctags "kinds" (single characters referring
		       to types of tags) that you want to omit from the types
		       file.  For example, for C code, function prototypes are
		       omitted (function definitions are included) by setting
		       SkipList to p.  To include multiple items, separate
		       each item with a comma.  To see a list of kinds for a
		       language, use:
>
			    ctags --list-kinds
<
	    SpecialSyntaxHandlers - This is for unusual cases where particular
				    syntax commands are required for a given
				    language.  Add any functions you want to
				    call here.  As an example, for Java code,
				    all syntax items must be added to the
				    javaTop cluster; this is done in a special
				    syntax handler.  For most languages this
				    is unnecessary.

    5. Add a modeline for consistency:
>
	# vim: ff=unix:noet
<
    5. Test your new language!

    6. Send me a copy for inclusion in the main distribution.

3.1.1 Example                            *TagHighlight-add-example*         {{{3

    It is worth looking at the existing language files for examples.  The C#
    language file is called csharp.txt and looks like this:
>
	FriendlyName:c#
	CTagsName:c#
	PythonExtensionMatcher:cs
	VimExtensionMatcher:cs
	Suffix:cs
	
	# vim: ff=unix:noet
<
    The friendly name and CTagsName are both 'c#' (it is quite normal for
    these to be the same).  Only one file extension is supported (cs), so the
    extension matchers are trivial.  The selected suffix is cs (this is the
    bit that goes in the filename).

    It really is that easy!

    - Highlighting of local variables (could be useful for checking your
      variable is defined in the correct function)?  Not currently possible as
      "ctags --c-kinds=+l" doesn't provide the scope of the local variable, so
      a lot of complicated parsing of the source would be required.
    
    - Option to update the types files whenever :make is run.
    
    - Option to update the types files whenever specific files are written
      (would need to make :UpdateTypesFile! much faster for this to be
      practical).
    
    - Make it work better with paths containing spaces.

r443 : 19th February 2011  : Allow customisation of the filenames used
                             for tags and types files (thanks to Sung Pae).

r442 : 16th February 2011  : Improved prioritisation of object-oriented
                             language types (thanks to Aleksey Baibarin).

r440 : 16th February 2011  : More explicit choice of C/C++ file extensions to
			     avoid conflicts with C# (thanks to Aleksey
			     Baibarin).

r439 : 10th February 2011  : Kill any cscope connections prior to running 
                             script in order to prevent cscope from locking
                             the cscope.out file.

r435 : 11th January 2011   : Changed default to not include syntax matches
                             unless either g:TypesFileIncludeSynMatches or
                             b:TypesFileIncludeSynMatches is set to 1 (this
                             makes the highlighting much faster for large
                             projects).

r431 : 2nd December 2010   : Add support for local variables in non-C
                             languages.

r429 : 2nd December 2010   : Improvements to cope with spaces in paths.

r425 : 16th November 2010  : Added support for Java and Android SDKs.

r410 : 9th September 2010  : Improved option configuration implementation.

r409 : 9th September 2010  : Allow cscope configuration options to be local
                             rather than buffer specific.

r398 : 29th March 2010     : Added support for python import in the listing.

r396 : 29th March 2010     : Factored out old ctags_[a-z] types to improve
                             language support.

r394 : 26th March 2010     : Fix for python use.

r391 : 2nd March 2010      : Fix for ctags names.

r390 : 2nd March 2010      : Attempted improvements to code including support
                             for C# (thanks to Aleksey Baibarin).

r387 : 20th February 2010  : Fixed VIMFILESDIR typo.

r384 : 19th February 2010  : Improvements to VIMFILESDIR identification.
                             Re-architecture of type definitions to make
                             them more sensitive to different ctags "kinds"
                             for different languages.  Note that Enumerator
                             has been renamed to EnumerationValue: the latest
                             Bandit Colour Scheme supports this.

r382 : 13th February 2010  : Fixed escaping of paths and operation of
                             ReadTypes when not in an autocommand.

r340 : 2nd November 2009   : Added missing winrestview().

r330 : 16th September 2009 : Minor Documentation update.

r329 : 16th September 2009 : Added revision output to mktypes.

r328 : 16th September 2009 : Fix for bug with path finding on Windows where
                             directories in the path end in a backslash.

r326 : 15th September 2009 : Added revision number to debug output.

r324 : 14th September 2009 : Fixed Linux bugs with new implementation.

r321 : 14th September 2009 : Fixed bug with returning to the correct window
			     after use, added debugging statements and moved
			     executable search to a separate function.  Also
			     added preliminary work towards more explicit
			     type names.

r309 : 17th August 2009    : Added documentation.

r302 : 10th August 2009    : Added experimental PHP support.

r301 : 7th August 2009     : Made GUI tags and types files optional and added
			     shellescape to protect paths (thanks to Mikhail
			     Stepura again). The gui_tags_and_types.vba file
			     contains the tags and highlighting definitions
			     for Qt, wxWidgets and wxPython (used to be
			     included in the main distribution).

r292 : 3rd August 2009     : Fixed bug with cscope option.

r285 : 27th July 2009      : Added support for ctags being stored in a path
			     with spaces and other odd characters (thanks to
			     Mikhail Stepura).

r261 : 23rd May 2009       : Changed some of the defaults to the python script
			     (so fewer options need to be passed by
			     UpdateTypesFile).  It should now be possible to
			     generate the types file simply by running
			     "mktypes.py" or "mktypes.py -r" in the project
			     directory.  Of course, UpdateTypesFile works too.
			     Added UpdateTypesFileOnly command for projects in
			     which the tags file is updated externally (e.g.
			     the Linux kernel source).  Removed regular
			     expression matches by default: this is much
			     quicker for large projects.

r252 : 21st May 2009       : Added (optional) support for highlighting of
			     local variables (not scope-specific: just
			     recognises names).  Tidied up tag generation.

r173 : 17th November 2008  : Added automatic reloading of types file whenever
			     :UpdateTypesFile is run.  Also runs cscope (in
			     the background) if cscope.files is present in the
			     current working directory.

r132 : 17th September 2008 : Updated to support limiting the languages checked
			     for (intended to be used with the project plugin
			     and it's in= option) in order to speed it up a
			     bit. Also added project option for recursion (so
			     you don't have to bother with the exclamation
			     mark) and parsing of local enumerations.
			     Finally, added sorting of tags file such that
			     function implementations come before function
			     declarations, regardless of the alphabetic order
			     of the file names in which they are stored.
			     Finally, added zipfile version in case of
			     problems with vba.

r129 : 9th September 2008  : Updated to only add to the various rainbow.vim
			     related groups if b:hlrainbow is set.

r126 : 5th September 2008  : This has now been updated to run considerably
			     quicker (with only one pass by ctags and
			     excluding directories named "docs" to avoid
			     spending a long time searching through all the
			     files that doxygen creates).  On the project I
			     used to benchmark it, the running time reduced
			     from about two minutes to about seven seconds!
